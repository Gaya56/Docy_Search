## 🛠 Architecture

Built on **Pydantic AI** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for clean, modular design:

```text
app.py                          # Main chat interface with project context loading
tool_recommendation/
└── mcp_server.py              # 🆕 Intelligent tool discovery & analysis
github_mcp_server.py           # 🆕 GitHub repository integration
brave_search.py                # Brave API integration
python_tools.py                # Data processing utilities
project_context.md             # Your project details (auto-loaded)
```

**Current Status:** Fully operational system with intelligent tool recommendation, GitHub integration, multi-AI support, interactive chat with permission prompts, project context awareness, and comprehensive development tool analysis capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Docy_Search

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```env
# Required for tool recommendation system
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_search_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Required for GitHub integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Optional: Choose your preferred AI model
AI_MODEL=gemini  # Options: openai, claude, gemini, deepseek

# Add other API keys as needed
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key
```

### 3. Set Up Project Context (Optional)

Create a `project_context.md` file with details about your project:

```bash
# Copy the example and customize it
cp project_context_example.md project_context.md
# Edit with your project details
nano project_context.md
```

The assistant will automatically load this context and provide more targeted recommendations based on your specific project, tech stack, and goals.

### 4. Test the System

```bash
# Test tool recommendation functionality
python tests/test_tool_recommendation.py

# Test GitHub integration
python tests/test_github_server.py

# Run demo examples
python demos/demo_tool_recommendation.py

# Start the interactive chat
python app.py
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Tool Discovery & Recommendations

```text
User: "I need tools for React web development"
Bot: I'll search for React development tools and analyze the best options...

User: "Compare Vue.js vs Angular"
Bot: I'll provide a detailed comparison of these JavaScript frameworks...

User: "How do I set up a Django project?"
Bot: I'll generate step-by-step setup instructions for Django development...
```

### GitHub Integration

```text
User: "Find the official React repository and show me setup examples"
Bot: I can search GitHub repositories for React setup examples. This will access public GitHub data to find official repositories and code examples. Continue? (y/n)

User: "y"
Bot: [Shows React repository details, stars, and relevant setup files]
```

### Development Workflows

```text
User: "What's the best database for a Node.js project?"
Bot: I'll recommend databases that work well with Node.js and provide setup guides...

User: "Set up a complete full-stack development environment"
Bot: I'll suggest tools and provide setup instructions for frontend, backend, and database tools...
```

### Project Context-Aware Recommendations

```text
User: "What tools would be best for this project?"
Bot: ✅ I have your project context loaded and ready to help!
     Based on your task management app with React + Node.js + PostgreSQL...
     [Provides targeted recommendations for your specific stack and challenges]
```

2. Follow the existing pattern (see `tool_recommendation/mcp_server.py` or `github_mcp_server.py`)
3. Add server to `app.py`
4. Update system prompt if needed

### Key Components:

- **MCP Servers**: Modular tools for specific functionality (tool search, GitHub integration, etc.)
- **Project Context**: Automatic loading of user project details for targeted recommendations
- **Permission System**: User consent required for external API calls (GitHub, web search)
- **Multi-AI Support**: Flexible AI model selection for different use cases

For detailed usage examples, see `Docs/Tool_Recommendation_Guide.md`.
